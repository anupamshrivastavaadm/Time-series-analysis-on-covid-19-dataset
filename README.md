# Time-series-analysis-on-covid-19-dataset

Here performing the following steps:

Load the Covid-19 dummy dataset and resample it to daily frequency.
Visualize the time series of daily new cases.
Check the stationarity of the time series using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
Fit an ARIMA model with one autoregressive term and one differencing term to the time series.
Print the summary of the fitted model.
Plot the residuals of the fitted model.


Note: This is just an simple program using dummy dataset and more analysis and model tuning can be performed based on the specific needs and goals of the analysis.
